# Product Store

The product store is an online food market that promotes healthy lifestyle. It was built to make several organic and fresh food available to consumers who desire to take care of their bodies the same way the body does for them. 

This is a responsive web application designed to facilate the consumers's experience when visiting our site.

# Tech stack

Here is an overview of all the tools used to build the site:

* This project uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as an app to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end.
* The design for the front-end is mostly handled by [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).
* The app uses [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) as its programming language.
* For massive storage (database), the app uses the [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) package which allows the app to create a schema and save the data to [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database.
